## Create a Instance role Elastic Beanstalk

When setting up an Elastic Beanstalk environment, we usually need to create an instance role that lets EC2 instances interact with other AWS services. However, for this project, we're not actually going to use the instance role for anything specific. We're just creating it to have it in place, but it won't have any policies attached - it's essentially just a placeholder.
